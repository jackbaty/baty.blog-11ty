# What I'm doing Now

Here are a few things I’m doing or learning or playing with these days[^thx]

-   Playing with Neovim and LazyVim for notes/editing
-   Reading “Pastoralia” by George Saunders
-   Experimenting with using as few apps as possible
-   Re-doing my blog in Eleventy. Trying to use just one blog.
