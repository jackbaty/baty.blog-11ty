I just realized that there's no way to search this blog. I wonder if I can use the same tooling as the Hugo blog. This doesn't seem like fun.

An admission: I'm using [TheBrain](https://thebrain.com) more again. Like [I did late last year](/2023/11/why-i-still-use-thebrain/). Its value increases over time. Whenever I put something in it, I can always find it later, and quickly. It may be weird and expensive and have limited export options, but it's still the app I've found most effective for things that benefit from context.
