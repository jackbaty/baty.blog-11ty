# About Me

<img style="float:left;padding-right:10px;" width="300" src="/img/self-portrait-with-m3-768x960.jpg">

Web developer, project/product manager, and founding partner at Fusionary Media (1995-2020). Iâ€™m now looking for my next thing. Iâ€™m good at process, requirements, user experience, documentation, and product/project management. If thereâ€™s anything you think I could do for you, let me know. Iâ€™ve been at this for a long time. I like to work with dev teams on whatever fascinates them.

I love photography and tinkering on the web.
