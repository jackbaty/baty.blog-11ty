[CJ Chilvers](https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/my-holy-grail-pen-and-paper):

> Writers spend way too much time and money seeking out their “grail” pen and paper combo — the tools that will make their work so much “smoother.” It’s a pattern we’ve seen repeated in all creative pursuits.

Why does he quote "smoother" here? Is that from something? It's an odd word for describing creative work.

I'm happy that Chilvers has a setup that works for him and that he doesn't feel a need to try anything else. A little envious, even. On the other hand, I don't love the insinuation that people who try different tools are somehow on a futile and unnecessary quest that can never lead to anything other than frustration and reduced creative output. OK, that might be me reading too much into it, but, isn't it possible that some people simply enjoy trying new things? Can the search for better or more enjoyable tools never be more than just blind consumerism or creative procrastination?
