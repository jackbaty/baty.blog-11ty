I’ve had this Minolta Autocord for so long I don’t remember where I got it. Or when, exactly.

My Minolta Autocord

Mine is a model RG-2 from 1962 with the Optiper-MVL shutter. I don’t know much else about the camera other than it’s fun but challenging to use. I keep thinking about taking it out for a spin but haven’t done that in a few years.

There’s more info about the Autocord at [camera-wiki.org](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Minolta_Autocord)

Here’s an example from the camera. It’s me trying a self-portrait while wearing Mario jammies of course.

And then there’s this crazy thing…
