Anyone following along with me here should be used to changes. I never leave this site alone for more than a couple months. Turnover has been unusually high recently, though. I've gone Hugo->WordPress->Hugo->Ghost->Hugo in the space of two months. And as of today, May 19, 2022, we're back in WordPress. Again.

There's no honest justification for moving back to WordPress other than "I wanted to." Over the past couple of weeks I have been running an experiment I'm calling [Reset to Defaults](https://wiki.baty.net/#Reset%20to%20Defaults). Basically, I'm trying to stop the ever-expanding complexity of my "system" by reverting to default apps and processes. I'm avoiding tools that lend themselves to endless tweaking.

How does WordPress fit into this? I'm not sure it does. My rationalization is that WordPress is easy, free (I already have a server), and does everything I _need_ right out of the box. 1 click. But mostly it's because the "default" way for me to blog is to hit a "Create Post" button...type some stuff...and hit "Publish". WordPress lets me do that. I need not worry about deployment scripts or format conversions or image resizing or local dependencies or any of that. Click...type...click. It's not cool, but it's good at what it does.
