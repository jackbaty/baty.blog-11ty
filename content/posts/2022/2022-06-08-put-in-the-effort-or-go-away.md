I understand the sentiment, but dammit, gatekeeping statements like that are unnecessarily off-putting for new users. Why are we surprised that people new to Emacs are initially befuddled by "buffers", "frames" and weird key combinations? I sure was! If the first thing someone said when I asked "why" or otherwise questioned the status quo was "go away," I would have done just that. And then we complain about the lack of uptake and "nebbishes".

Do better.
