Somehow my attempt at blog consolidation has drifted out of focus and I'm once again posting willy-nilly all over the place. For example, just today I've posted on [Write.as](https://write.as/jackbaty), [my wiki](https://wiki.baty.net), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty), [Drummer](http://oldschool.scripting.com/jackbaty/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/web/@jackbaty), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jackbaty), and finally, here at baty.net. I recently paused my Micro.blog subscription and Tumblr gives me a headache, or I'd probably have written there, too.

I don't know what to do about this, or if something even needs doing. I'm just making a note of it. I still dream of having One True Websiteâ„¢ but we all know that will probably remain nothing more than a dream.
