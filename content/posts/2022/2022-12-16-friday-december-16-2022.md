This post is an experiment. I've been writing daily notes _somewhere_ for a long time, but never using WordPress. Lately, it's been on my Tinderbox blog at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog). What if I just did it here instead?

Can you tell that I'm nearly catatonic today over blogging platforms? I am unable to decide what goes where and how. Crazy-making!

I'm testing the Independent Publisher theme here. I used it years ago and have always liked its simplicity. But, is it _too_ simple? Later: Turns out that yes, it was too simple.
