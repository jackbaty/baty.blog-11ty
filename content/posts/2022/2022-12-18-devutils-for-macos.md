[DevUtils](https://devutils.com/) is an "All-in-one Toolbox for Developers" available for macOS.

This thing has everything. I might regularly use only a handful of the available tools, but DevUtils sure makes them handy. It's $29 for a license and is also available via [SetApp](https://go.setapp.com/stp307?refAppID=445).
