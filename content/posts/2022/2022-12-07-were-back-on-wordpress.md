I need a break from using an SSG for this site. I don't feel like fighting with go templates. I don't feel like troubleshooting Hugo modules when they break. When I want to edit a post, I want to just click "Edit" and not have to go find the original Org-mode entry, then re-export to Markdown, then build and deploy the whole site every time. I'm in the mood to Click "Edit"->Type->Click "Publish". I want to just drag a bunch of images into a post and have a nice gallery built for me. I want comments, stats, easy upgrades, and endless plugins for the picking.

WordPress, for all its many faults, satisfies all of the above.
