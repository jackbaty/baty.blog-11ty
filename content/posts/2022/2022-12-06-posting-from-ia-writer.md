This post, in iA Writer

Sometimes I feel like changing things up a little. I get bored writing the same way using the [same app for everything](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Today, for example, I'm typing this in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). Writer is a very nice, simple, lovely app for writing Markdown that can post directly to WordPress and is a nice change of pace.
