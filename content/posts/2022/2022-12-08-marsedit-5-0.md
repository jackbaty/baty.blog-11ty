I can\`t even tell you how long I've loved [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) for posting to WordPress blogs. It's been a while since I've used it as I've mostly been off WordPress. Now that we're [back on WordPress](https://baty.net/2022/were-back-on-wordpress), the [announcement of MarsEdit 5.0](https://redsweater.com/blog/3955/marsedit-5-like-wow) is welcome.

I'm most curious to try the new syntax highlighting for Markdown as well as the microblogging features. And the new icon is nice, too.

You're soaking in it.
