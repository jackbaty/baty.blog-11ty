I'm sick of looking at my own stupid face everywhere, so I'm bringing back my old avatar, "Pipe Guy".

Here he is:

"Pipe Guy"

I wrote about where this came from a few years ago in [The origin of my avatar](https://archive.baty.net/avatar/), but the short version it came from this old found photo from the early 1900s:

That photography makes me happy, and I'm reminded of it whenever I see the avatar.
