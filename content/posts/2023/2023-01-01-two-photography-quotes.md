These quotes resonated with me recently, especially the second one, from Alan Burles.

> One must work hard to smuggle anything into a photograph other than record keeping.

> [Erwin Blumenfeld](https://erwinblumenfeld.com/)

> Unless we are having lots of life moments, how can we have any photography moments?
>
