We've wasted a decade listening to the loud minority. It's why I stopped caring about web development. Maybe there really will be a sea change. If so, I'd like to come back.

> Always remember that although a **subset of the JavaScript community** can be **very loud**, they represent a **paltry portion of the web as a whole**. This means that when _they_ say something like “Best practices don’t actually work”—what they mean is “Best practices don’t actually work for a small subset of less than 5 percent of the web”
