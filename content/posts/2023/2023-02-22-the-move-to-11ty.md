If you're reading this, I have successfully migrated the content from my WordPress blog at [baty.net](https://baty.net) here to baty.blog.

Why? Who knows? Probably because I can only stand so much WordPress. WordPress is completely capable and does everything pretty easily. But it just sucks to actually _write_ in. So I start to miss the clean writing environment of static websites and start moving everything back to Markdown files. This time, I decided to use [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).

As fast and dependency-free as Hugo is, I have trouble with its templating language and rendering hierarchy. At one time, I thought I might want to learn Go, so Hugo made sense. Let's face it, I'm never going to get around to learning Go. JavaScript is probably the most immediately useful language to be in, so Eleventy it is.

This site is a slightly modified version of the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter template. I'm staying as close to stock as I can while I learn my way around.

Oh, and getting everything moved out of WordPress was made much easier with [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown).
