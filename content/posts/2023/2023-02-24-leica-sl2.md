I got a new (to me) Leica SL2 today. This felt inevitable. After an almost accidental[^accident] run with the Panasonic S5, I tried going back to the Fuji system. I didn't enjoy the S5 at all. I've always liked Fujifilm cameras and their old-school control layout. I purchased a new X-T5 and set of lenses late last year. And then it didn't grow on me. The X-T5 is a great camera and I had nothing to complain about. Except it just didn't give me The Feels. Not the way, say, a Leica does.

I decided that I wasn't going to be satisfied until I was back with Leica for my digital camera. My heart told me to get another M10-R but I know how that turns out[^results].

Making formal portraits for my extended family has been on the back burner for a couple of years, and I'd like to get started on that, so I thought I'd move toward a more flexible mirrorless system and ended up with the above SL2.

I've owned the lower-resolution SL2-S before, and it was fantastic, but at the time I was looking into digital black and white so I traded it for a Q2 Monochrom. That was fun, but this time I need to be more practical, so I opted for the 47 Megapixel SL2.

The second I picked up the SL2 I knew I'd done the right thing and promptly forgot about the price. The SL2 is dense, heavy, solid, and feels perfect in hand. It definitely gives me The Feels. I no longer have any native Leica L-mount lenses, but I do have a couple of very good Sigma lenses: The 35mm f2.0 DG DN "Contemporary" and the amazing 85mm f1.4 "Art" lens. I also intend to spend a lot of time with my Leica M lenses mounted via the Leica M-Adapter L. The SL2's viewfinder is second to none and, with focus peaking, makes using manual focus lenses as easy as it gets.

Now it's up to me to go _do_ something with it.

[^accident]: I bought the S5 specifically for scanning film. Using it as a camera was a nice side effect.
[^results]: I have already owned (and then sold) an M10-R, twice.
