Long story, short, I sold my precious Leica M6 (Classic). I could no longer justify having two modern Leica M cameras, so I decided to keep the beautiful MP and pass the M6 on to someone else. I'm sure I'll regret this. (It's the second time the camera has been sold, but the previous buyer returned it, for spurious reasons). Onward!

Here's the final frame I shot with the camera:
